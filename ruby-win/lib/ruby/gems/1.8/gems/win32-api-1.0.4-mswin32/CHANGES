= 1.0.4 - 26-Oct-2007
* Fixed a bug where methods that returned pointers ('P') could choke if the
  resulting pointer was 0 or NULL. In this case, nil is now returned instead.
* Tweak to the extconf.rb file that helps the gem build it from source
  properly.

= 1.0.3 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a subtle but dangerous copy-on-write bug in the API#call method.

= 1.0.2 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a bug in an internal struct member that was causing segfaults. Thanks
  go to Lars Olsson for the spot.
* Fixed the 'install' task in the Rakefile. This only affected native builds,
  not the prebuilt binary.
* Added a few more tests.

= 1.0.1 - 27-Sep-2007
* Functions declared with a void prototype no longer require an explicit nil
  argument to fulfill the arity requirement. You can still call them with an
  explicit nil if you wish, however.
* Fixed the gemspec for the native build.

= 1.0.0 - 14-Sep-2007
* Initial release
